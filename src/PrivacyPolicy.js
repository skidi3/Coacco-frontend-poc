          <h4>Security of our Customers</h4>
          <p>
            The security of our customers is a matter of great importance, and
            we are committed to protecting your privacy online. This page
            explains our privacy and data policy, applicable to this and all
            other websites operated by Nestaway Boats Ltd. We aim to safeguard
            our users’ privacy whilst providing a personalised and we hope
            valuable service. Collecting some personal information is necessary
            to satisfy the expectations of our users. We understand that you do
            not want your personal information distributed indiscriminately and
            here we explain how we collect information, what we do with it and
            what controls you have.
          </p>
          <h4>What informations do we collect!!</h4>
          <p>
            We only collect information that we feel is necessary to process
            orders and manage our communications efficiently. We collect two
            kinds of information about our users: 1. Non-personal information
            such as IP address (the location of the computer on the internet),
            pages accessed and files downloaded. This helps us calculate
            statistics such as how many individuals use our sites, how many
            people visit on a regular basis, which pages are most popular and
            which pages are least popular. This information doesn’t tell us
            anything about who you are or where you live, it simply allows us to
            monitor and improve our service. 2. Personal information such as
            name, postal address, telephone number, and email address etc. We
            collect this information only in connection with specific
            activities, such as brochure requests, product purchases, feedback
            etc. The information is either needed to fulfil your request or to
            enable us to provide you with a more personalised service. You don’t
            have to disclose any of this information to browse the sites.
            However, if you do choose to withhold requested information, we may
            not be able to provide you with certain services.
          </p>
          <h4>Security</h4>
          <p>
            Your account is password protected. We use industry standard
            measures to protect the personal information that is stored in our
            database. We limit the access to your personal information to those
            employees and contractors who need access to perform their job
            function, such as our customer service personnel. If you have any
            questions about the security on NoBroker.in, please contact us.
            Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against
            unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that
            your personal information will never be disclosed in a manner that
            is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.

            and will never be sent any email from NoBroker.in
